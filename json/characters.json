      "about": "Rama, one of the most widely worshipped Hindu deities, considered the epitome of moral virtue and royal conduct. Although there are three Ramas mentioned in Indian tradition—Parashurama, Balarama, and Ramachandra—the name is specifically associated with Ramachandra, the seventh incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu. His story is told briefly in the Mahabharata (“Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty”), at great length in the Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”), and in many other texts from South Asia and Southeast Asia where he holds strong religious and cultural significance. While known in Sanskrit and many other languages as “Rama,” he is commonly referred to as “Ram” in North Indian languages, such as Hindi, that delete the final “a” sound. the story of Rama the core of Rama's story, as detailed in the Ramayana, begins in the city of Ayodhya, where Rama is the firstborn son of the king Dasharatha and queen Kaushalya. As a member of the royal and martial Kshatriya varna (social class), he displays his mettle as a great archer early on by defeating demons threatening to disrupt the performance of a sacrifice and by stringing a giant bow belonging to Shiva. By that feat, he wins his wife, Sita. Regarded as the most wise and virtuous of the king’s sons, he is chosen as heir. However, the queen Kaikeyi, owed a boon by Dasharatha, requests that her son, Bharata, be crowned and Rama banished to the forest for 14 years. Rama, ever the obedient son, complies and journeys off to the forest accompanied by Sita and his brother Lakshmana, much to the chagrin of the kingdom's people. in the forest the trio is approached by the female demon (rakshasa) Shurpanakha, who offers herself in marriage to Rama. Rama refuses, and she is mutilated by Lakshmana. She retreats to the island city of Lanka and tells her story to her brother, the 10-headed demon king Ravana. Ravana, hearing of Sita's beauty, decides to steal her away from Rama. He tricks the wandering trio through disguises and abducts Sita. as a forlorn Rama seeks his wife, he encounters a kingdom of monkeys and enlists the aid of Hanuman, their commander. Together with Hanuman and his monkey army, Rama builds a bridge to Lanka. In a great battle, Rama kills the demon Ravana. Rama is initially hesitant to take Sita back, because he suspects her of infidelity, but she proves her chastity in a trial by fire. Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and Hanuman return to Ayodhya, where, the years of exile having elapsed, Rama is crowned king and rules over a prosperous kingdom. However, doubts of Sita’s fidelity during her imprisonment in Lanka persist, and Rama banishes her. Pregnant with Rama’s twin sons, Lava and Kusha, Sita finds refuge in the hermitage of the sage Valmiki. The reputed author of the Ramayana itself, Valmiki teaches the poetic tale of Rama to Lava and Kusha, which they later recite to their father at a sacrifice. Sita joins the crowd, and Rama again requests that she prove her fidelity. In front of the people assembled and various deities in attendance, she makes a vow that if she never thought of any man but Rama, may her mother, the Earth, create a chasm for her. The ground opens up, a throne arises, and she is immediately swallowed into the Earth, much to Rama’s dismay. At the end of his life, according to the last book of the Ramayana, Rama meets with a sage who informs Rama of his divinity as an incarnation of Vishnu and requests that Rama ascend back to heaven to be with the gods"

      "about": "Sita, in Hinduism, the consort of the god Rama. Her abduction by the demon king Ravana and subsequent rescue are the central incidents in the great Hindu epic Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”). Sita was raised by King Janaka; she was not his natural daughter but sprang from a furrow when he was ploughing his field. Rama won her as his bride by bending Shiva’s bow, and she accompanied her husband when he went into exile. Though carried away to Lanka by Ravana, she kept herself chaste by concentrating her heart on Rama throughout her long imprisonment. On her return she asserted her purity and also proved it by voluntarily undergoing an ordeal by fire. Rama, however, banished her to the forest in deference to public opinion. There she gave birth to their two children, Kusha and Lava. After they reached maturity and were acknowledged by Rama to be his sons, she called upon her mother, Earth, to swallow her up. Sita is worshipped as the incarnation of Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu Though often regarded as the embodiment of wifely devotion and self-sacrifice, she is critical of Rama at times, even in the earliest version of the Ramayana, and in some of the later versions of the story she departs from the idealized, chaste image of the earlier text. She is frequently depicted in Indian miniature paintings of the Ramayana and in South Indian bronzes. These usually form a group, with images of Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his devotee, the monkey Hanuman. The iconographic texts instruct the artist to show Sita looking at her husband with supreme happiness."

      "name": "Hanuman",
      "image": "../images/characters/hanuman.jpeg",
      "about": "Hanuman, in Hindu mythology, the monkey commander of the monkey army. His exploits are narrated in the great Hindu Sanskrit poem the Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”). While still a baby, Hanuman, the child of a nymph by the wind god, tried to fly up and grab the Sun, which he mistook for a fruit. Indra, the king of the gods, struck Hanuman with a thunderbolt on the jaw (hanu), thus inspiring the name. When Hanuman continued to misbehave, powerful sages cursed him to forget his magic powers, such as the ability to fly or to become infinitely large, until he was reminded of them. Hanuman led the monkeys to help Rama, an avatar (incarnation) of the god Vishnu, recover Rama’s wife, Sita, from the demon Ravana, king of Lanka (likely not the present-day Sri Lanka). Having been reminded of his powers by Jambavan, the king of the bears, Hanuman crossed the strait between India and Lanka in one leap, despite the efforts of watery demonesses to stop him by swallowing him or his shadow. He was discovered in Lanka, and his tail was set on fire, but he used that fire to burn down Lanka. Hanuman also flew to the Himalayas and returned with a mountain full of medicinal herbs to restore the wounded in Rama’s army. Hanuman is worshipped as a subsidiary figure in temples dedicated to Rama or directly in shrines dedicated to Hanuman himself. The latter are generally thronged by monkeys, who know that they cannot be mistreated there. In temples throughout India, he appears in the form of a monkey with a red face who stands erect like a human. For his service to Rama, Hanuman is upheld as a model for all human devotion (bhakti).Hanuman is also a popular figure among Buddhists in Central, Southeast, and East Asia, and throughout those areas many temples have been erected for his worship and districts of towns bear his name. Outside India, however, rather different tales are told of him. Although steadfastly chaste in the Sanskrit tradition, for instance, he has wives and children in other traditions. He has been identified as the inspiration for the monkey hero of the great Chinese poem Xiyouji (“Journey to the West”). In India Hanuman is revered by the nationalist Hindu organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and he has been depicted as a fierce superhero in a popular series of comic books. The Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus entellus), one of the most common Indian monkeys, is named after the Ramayana character.."

When his mother, Kaikeyi, wanted him to be the king of Ayodhya instead of Sri Ram; he refused and rebuked his mother. Bharata performed the last rites of his father who had died of shock at Sri Ram’s departure to the forest. He declined to wear the crown and decided to go to the forest and bring back Sri Ram. When he reached the forest, Sri Ram declined to return and asked Bharata to rule Ayodhya in his place. Bharata accepted Sri Ram’s advice. He placed Sri Ram’s sandals on the throne and ruled on behalf of Sri Ram. He built a thatched hut for himself away from the city and lived and austere life similar to that of Sri Rama’s in the forest. Bharata is eulogized in almost all literary works based on the Ramayana.

Dashrath shot off arrows and told the messengers that, when they get back, they’d discover the gates of Ravan’s capital Lanka shut by the arrows.He conducted two yajnas with the help of Sage Rishyasringa on the advice of Vashistha.  By performing the Putrakameshti yagna to get children, he was blessed with four sons.

He is an ally of Lord Rama in the quest to defeat demon-king Ravana who has abducted Rama's wife Sita. Lord Rama meets SugreevaLord Rama meets Sugriva or Sugreeva from the Ramayana is a very essential player in the fight against Ravana. Lord Rama meets Sugreeva - the exiled king of Kishkindha, through Hanuman. Not just in Valmiki Ramayan, but in the Javanese (Indonesian) Kakawin Ramayana too Sugreeva's character plays an important part. It is Sugriv who assists Lord Rama in his mission to free his wife Sita from the captivity of Ravana. Sugreeva is the younger brother of Vali (also called Bali) the ruler of the Vanara people of Kishkindha. Sugreeva's wife is Ruma and he is the son of Surya, the Sun God. There is a huge misunderstanding between the two brothers. Bali's wife is Tara. Once, when Bali, the king of Kishkindha, follows a demon during a chase - into a cave and is assumed dead as he does not come back in time and there is a blood trail that hints to his likely death. Shocked that Sugreeva comes back to Kishkindha and takes charge of the kingdom and also marries Tara the wife of his brother who has now been presumed dead. Bali returns and is furious to see his brother in charge of everything that was once his. He assumes that Sugreeva betrayed him and gets him thrown out of the kingdom without a fair hearing. Now Bali also forcibly appropriates Sugriv’s wife, Ruma. It is Hanuman who leads Rama to meet Sugreeva when the exiled prince of Ayodhya is on his way to look for Sita (abducted by Ravana). Rama promises Sugreeva that the wrong done to him will be righted and that he will be reinstated as the king of the Vanaras. When Sugreeva and Bali clash, Rama stays as support to Sugreeva and at an opportune moment puts an arrow through Bali's heart. Bali gets his kingdom and wife back as well as Tara. But he also anoints Bali and Tara's son Angad as the crown prince. The rest is history. We all know how Sugreeva's Vanara Sena (army of monkey people) help build a bridge across the sea (the Palk strait) that lies between present-day Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka's Mannar Island. Sugriva helped Rama to conquer Lanka and rescue Sita but almost meets his end in his fight against Kumbhakarna, the brother of Ravana. When Sugreeva attacks the giant who is notoriously well-known for his months-long sleep patterns, the latter is not hurt at all by the tree smashing on his head. Kumbhakarna attacks Sugreeva viciously. Laxman rushes to Sugriva's rescue. After the war, Sugreeva returns to Kishkindha with his Vanarasena and Ram, Laxman, Sita and Hanuma head towards Ayodhya."

      "image": "../images/characters/Vibhishana.jpeg",
      "about": "Vibhishana, the younger brother of Ravana, plays a significant role in the epic Ramayana. Born as the youngest son of the rakshasi Kaikesi and the sage Vishrava, Vibhishana was the brother of the mighty Ravana and Kumbhakarna. Despite his rakshasa lineage, Vibhishana considered himself a Brahmin due to his father's sagehood, marking the beginning of his differences with Ravana. Vibhishana's moral compass led him to oppose Ravana's actions, particularly the kidnapping of Sita. Fleeing Lanka, he sought refuge with Sri Ram, who was assembling an army to defeat Ravana and rescue his wife. Vibhishana's decision to divulge Ravana's secrets ensured Sri Ram's victory in the great battle. After Sri Ram's triumph over Ravana, Vibhishana was crowned as the King of Lanka. In some versions of the epic, he takes Ravana's queen Mandodari as his second wife, while in others, he seeks her blessings during his coronation. Vibhishana's intimate knowledge of Lanka's secrets proved invaluable to Sri Ram during the war. He disclosed crucial information, including the secret path to the temple of Nikumbala, aiding Sri Ram's strategic moves. In the climactic battle, Vibhishana revealed the key to Ravana's invulnerability, enabling Sri Ram to emerge victorious. Upon Sri Ram's departure from Ayodhya, he instructed Vibhishana to stay on earth, serve the people, and guide them in the path of truth and dharma. Vibhishana thus became one of the Chiranjivis, the eight immortals, and was tasked with praying to the family deity of the Solar dynasty, Ranganatha. The Ramayana highlights Vibhishana's character as a means to illustrate the practical implications of the concept of dharma. It emphasizes that moral dilemmas can be approached in different ways, showcasing Vibhishana's choice to oppose his kin when advice failed, in contrast to Kumbhakarna's loyalty to kin despite failed advice. Vibhishana's significance extends to regional legends, such as his association with the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. Here, he plays a crucial role in the consecration of the Sri Ranga vimana, showcasing his enduring connection with Vishnu. Vibhishana's journey in the Ramayana is a tale of redemption, morality, and loyalty. From defying his rakshasa lineage to becoming a revered king, Vibhishana's character resonates with timeless lessons. As we delve into the epic, we witness the transformative power of dharma and the enduring legacy of a character who chose the path of righteousness."

      "name": "Ravana",
      "image": "../images/characters/Ravan1.jpeg",
      "about": "Ravana, the central antagonist in the Indian epic Ramayana, is one of Hindu mythology’s most complex and intriguing characters. As the powerful and multifaceted ruler of Lanka, Ravana’s life is marked by his extraordinary birth, acquisition of immense power, significant life events, and his pivotal role in the Ramayana. Ravana’s origin is shrouded in mystique and divine intervention. According to Hindu mythology, Ravana was born to the sage Vishrava and the rakshasi (demoness) Kaikasi. Vishrava was a renowned sage with celestial lineage, and Kaikasi sought an invincible son. To fulfill her desire, she performed severe penance, and Brahma granted her the boon of a son with exceptional strength and intellect. Born with ten heads and twenty arms, Ravana displayed extraordinary prowess from a young age. A dedication to knowledge, austerities, and the pursuit of power marked his early years. One of the most famous episodes in Ravana’s life is his penance and devotion to Lord Shiva. Determined to obtain immense power, Ravana performed severe penance for thousands of years. In his unwavering devotion, he went to such extremes that he even sacrificed his heads, one by one, as an offering to Lord Shiva. Impressed by Ravana’s dedication, Lord Shiva granted him the boon of invincibility, making him nearly immortal. Ravana also received powerful celestial weapons and immense strength, becoming a formidable force in the three worlds. Ravana’s rule over Lanka, a prosperous and advanced kingdom inhabited by rakshasas, is a significant aspect of his life. Lanka was described as a magnificent city with architectural marvels and technological advancements. Under Ravana’s reign, Lanka flourished and was regarded as a brilliant and capable ruler. Despite his accomplishments, Ravana’s rule was marred by his arrogance and the misuse of his powers. His desire for conquest and dominance led him to perform numerous misdeeds, and his tyranny extended to the celestial beings, sages, and even the gods. Ravana’s character in the Ramayana symbolizes the consequences of unchecked ambition, arrogance, and the misuse of power. His story presents moral complexities, highlighting that even those with excellent knowledge and strength can succumb to the flaws of human nature. Ravana’s tragic downfall emphasizes the importance of righteousness (dharma) and humility in the face of power. His character invites contemplation on the complexities of good and evil, destiny, and the consequences of one’s actions. While Ravana is a formidable antagonist, his life story carries profound lessons that resonate across cultures and generations."

Even with his gigantic size and great urge for food, he was described to be of good character, though he killed and ate many monks simply to display his power.Kumbhakarna was considered so pious, intelligent and brave that Indra, the king of gods, was jealous of him. He carried out a major yajna with his brothers to impress Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma was pleased, he asked for his wish. Kumbhakarna instead of demanding Indrasana (Lord Indra’s throne), requested for Nidrasana (a bed to sleep). It is claimed that goddess Saraswati cast a spell on Kumbhakarna on the request of Lord Indra where he was tongue-tied while asking for his wish. Ravana requested Brahma to undo this boon as it was in reality a bane. Kumbhakarna slept for half a year and when he awoke, he ate all things the vicinity, including human beings. It is belived that no one in the whole Indralok could ever defeat Kumbhakarna. He was thought of as the most powerful in the entire universe, and even Indra Dev was jealous that his indrasena wouldn’t defeat him. In the war, Ravana was embarrassed by Rama and his army so he decided to awaken his brother Kumbhakarna. Kumbhakarna knew that the war against Rama was useless. He made an effort to convince Ravana that what he was doing was wrong. However, he fought for his brother’s pride and did not leave his side, unlike Vibhishana who backed Rama. He ruined Ram’s army, injured Hanuman, and knocked Sugriv unconscious and took him as a prisoner . Therefore Rama took the charge of the battle by himself. Kumbhakarn had magical power and he was skilled with many illusive forms to confuse the enemy. The battle went on for quite a while. Finally Rama attacked Kumbhakarn with his most effective arrow strengthened with deadly divine missile. When this missile hit Kumbhakarn his life came to an end. When Ravana heard of his brother’s death, he fainted and announced that he was doomed. Kumbhakarna had two sons, Kumbha and Nikumbha, who also fought against Rama and were killed. Kumbhakarn was considered one of the most interesting characters in the epic Ramayana. He was able to realize the mistakes and wrong-doings of Ravana, even tried to intervene and moderate at certain times. Fighting on what he knew was the wrong side, he was ultimately killed in battle."

      "about": "Vali is the initial king of the monkeys in Kiskinda. He's a very powerful being in his own right, but he also has the special power of being nearly invincible. When someone wishes to fight Vali, they give up half their power to Vali, making him even stronger. However, this power makes Vali an unwilling listener. He banishes his brother, Sugreeva, because he was unwilling to listen to Sugreeva's truthful account of a past event, and instead Vali chose to believe that Sugreeva wanted to usurp him. This lack of rational and considerate thought leads Rama to side with Sugreeva and kill Vali without listening to Vali's version of events. However, as Vali dies, Rama convinces him that even though he's a monkey, he is capable of accessing and using a more nuanced and human system of conduct and thought. This allows Vali to find eternal peace in the afterworld."

When the troop of monkeys with Tara had reached the beach side and had to cross to Lanka, it was Tara, who announced the willingness to go to search Sita alone across the sea. But the old bear Jambava had objected saying her presence was more warranted near her son Angada, besides, it was not proper for her to jump to Lanka, she being a senior diplomat whose husband once punished Ravana. And hence the name of Hanuman had been suggested by him as an alternative. after order issue by Sugriva, the army of Kishikindha had marched to Lanka, waging war with Ravana. Tara remained in the palace to look after the kingdom. After victory over Ravana, and during their journey to Ayodhya, Angada, with Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had stopped their flight, Pushpaka Vimana at Kishkindha.
